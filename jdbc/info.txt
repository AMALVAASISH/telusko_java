jdbc - java databse connectivity

there are 7 steps to do to connectivity
1.import the package (java.sql.*)

2. load the driver and register
(driver for mysql - com.mysql.jdbc.driver)

for that , you have to download a .jar file
mysql-connector (eclipse), its in built in net beans

to register, a method forName("com.mysql.jdbc.driver") is used

3. establlish teh connection
instantiate the connection

4. create the statement
three types of statement: normal,prepared and callable statements

5. execute the query

6.process results

7. close the connection


import java.sql.*;

public static void main(){

}

Class.forName(""com.mysql.jbdc.Driver)

Connection con = DriverManager getConnection("URL","uName","password")
// getConnection is static

statement st = con.CreateStatement();

ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery('select * from students')
(ResultSet is a interface)

rs.next() - to shift to next row  
rs.getInt(1) + " " + rs.getString(2)

// loop can be used here

while(rs.next()){
    rs.getInt(1) + " " + rs.getString(2)
    
}

st.close();
con.close();
